Power VIM Users like us have already wasted tons of time to choose
our favorite colorschemes, and may still not be satisfied with the
current colorschemes. So I wrote this plugin to help us out, to
meet the perfect colorsheme that we are DESTINED to be with.
just like your lovely girlfriends/wifes:)
Written by sunus Lee
Usage:
When you use vim open a file, I will randomly pick up a colorscheme for you.
    ALL The Commands below are CaseSensitive
    if you LOVE this colorscheme,
    Enter( In Normal Mode )
    :Love
    then I will never change your colorscheme again.
    if you HATE this colorscheme and don't want to see her again,
    Enter( In Normal Mode )
    :Hate
    then I will never pick this colorscheme for you and then
    randomly pick a new coloscheme.
    if you somehow regret what you did and want to get the hated colorscheme back,
    Enter(In Normal Mode)
    :Back
    then all you hated colorschem will back to select pool, and you might see
    her again:)
    Enter(In Normal Mode)
    :CS
    to see current colorscheme
Tips
Use this plugin with a large colorsheme pool
will increase the possibility of meeting the right ColorScheme for you.
So, I recommand you also use the ColorScheme Pack at:
vimscript #625
Colo(u)r Sampler Pack : Oct 2012 Update
